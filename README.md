# WhatsBruin
_A personalized event calendar for UCLA students._

Sports games, club meetings, activities on the Hillâ€”currently, there is no truly centralized place where students can view all upcoming events that match their interests. But _WhatsBruin_ solves this problem by providing students with a way to explore, filter, and save events they're interested in, allowing them to truly focus on enjoying the college experience!
